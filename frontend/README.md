- This travel time task is for users to book their flight. Each person can book more than one flight but not with the same time and date. This helps to check if a user has already booked a flight on that particular day and time.

- The website is built using reactJS framework with tailwindcss for styling.

- For simplicity , the codebase has been kept minimal and only includes necessary components to demonstrate functionality of the app.

- It uses the useState and useEffect hooks.

- I used react-router-dom to navigate between different pages of the application.

- I installed Redux to connect api calls from server to the client side and vice versa.

- For state management, redux was implemented along with react-redux library which provides a convenient way to access store data in components.

- For storage of data , I used MongoDB database which stores user information and all booked trip .

- The component folder in the src folder contains all components representing the pages of the website.

- The home page displays all necessary information to fill for the booking flight.

- The Header/Navigation component is a reusable component that represents the navigation bar on every page, it includes links to Home and logout of your account

### Installation

- I installed tailwindcss, react-router-dom , react-icons, dotenv by running `npm install --save tailwindcss react-router-dom react-edux in my application
